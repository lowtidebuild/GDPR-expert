Executive summary

In  these  Guidelines,  the  EDPB  addresses  the  applicability  of  Article  5(3)  of  the  ePrivacy  Directive
to different technical solutions. These Guidelines expand upon the Opinion 9/2014 of the Article 29
Working  Party  on  the  application  of  ePrivacy  Directive  to  device  fingerprinting  and  aim  to  provide
a clear understanding of the technical operations covered by Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive.

The emergence of new tracking methods to both replace existing tracking tools (for example, cookies,
due  to  discontinued  support  for  third-party  cookies  by  some  browser  vendors)  and  create  new
business models has become a critical data protection concern. While the applicability of Article 5(3)
of  the  ePrivacy  Directive  is  well  established  and  implemented  for  some  tracking  technologies  such
as  cookies,  there  is  a  need  to  address  ambiguities  related  to  the  application  of  the  said  provision
to emerging tracking tools.

The Guidelines identify three key elements for the applicability of Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive
(section 2.1), namely ‘information’, ‘terminal equipment of a subscriber or user’ and ‘gaining access
and ‘storage of information and stored information’. The Guidelines further provide a detailed analysis
of each element (section 2.2-2.6).

In  section  3,  that  analysis  is  applied  to  a  non-exhaustive  list  of  use  cases  representing  common
techniques, namely:

- URL and pixel tracking
- Local processing
- Tracking based on IP only
- Intermittent and mediated Internet of Things (IoT) reporting
- Unique Identifier

Having  regard  to  Article  70  (1)(e)  of  the  Regulation  2016/679/EU  of  the  European  Parliament  and
of  the  Council  of  27  April  2016  on  the  protection  of  natural  persons  with  regard  to  the  processing
of  personal  data  and  on  the  free  movement  of  such  data,  and  repealing  Directive  95/46/EC,

Having regard to the EEA Agreement and in particular to Annex XI and Protocol 37 thereof, as amended
by the Decision of the EEA joint Committee No 154/2018 of 6 July 20181,

Having  regard  to  Article  15(3)  of  the  Directive  2002/58/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and
of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy
in the electronic communications sector, as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC (hereinafter, ‘ePrivacy
Directive’ or ‘ePD’),

Having regard to Article 12 and Article 22 of its Rules of Procedure,

HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES:

INTRODUCTION

1.

2.

According  to  Article  5(3)  ePD,  ‘the  storing  of  information,  or  the  gaining  of  access  to  information
already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user’ is only allowed on the basis of consent
or necessity for specific purposes set out in that Article. As reminded in Recital 24 of the ePD2, the goal
of that provision is to protect the users’ terminal equipment, as they are part of the private sphere
of the users.  It results from the wording of the Article, that Article 5(3) ePD does not exclusively apply
to  cookies,  but  also  to  ‘similar  technologies’.  However,  there  is  currently  no  comprehensive  list
of the technical operations covered by Article 5(3) ePD.

Article 29 Working Party (hereinafter, ‘WP29’) Opinion 9/2014 on the application of ePrivacy Directive
to device fingerprinting (hereinafter, ‘WP29 Opinion 9/2014’) has already clarified that fingerprinting
falls  within  the  technical  scope  of  Article  5(3)  ePD3,  but  due  to  the  new  advances  in  technologies
further guidance is needed with respect to the tracking techniques currently observed. The technical
landscape has been evolving during the last decade, with the increasing use of identifiers embedded
in  operating  systems,  as  well  as  the  creation  of  new  tools  allowing  the  storage  of  information
in terminal equipment.

information, to store hidden information or to trace the activities of the user and may seriously intrude upon
the privacy of these users. The use of such devices should be allowed only for legitimate purposes, with the
knowledge of the users concerned.’

The  ambiguities  regarding  the  scope  of  application  of  Article  5(3)  ePD  have  created  incentives
to implement alternative solutions for tracking internet users and lead to a tendency to circumvent
the  legal  obligations  provided  by  Article  5(3)  ePD.  All  such  situations  raise  concerns  and  require
a supplementary analysis in order to complement the previous guidance from the EDPB.

The aim of these Guidelines is to conduct a technical analysis on the scope of application of Article 5(3)
ePD, namely to clarify what is technically covered by the phrase ‘to store information or to gain access
to  information  stored  in  the  terminal  equipment  of  a  subscriber  or  user’.  These  Guidelines  do  not
address the circumstances under which a processing operation may fall within the exemptions from
the  consent  requirement  provided  for  by  the  ePD4,  as  these  circumstances  should  be  analysed  on
a case-by-case basis accounting for the relevant member state transposition(s), and guidance issued
by national Competent Authorities.

5.

A non-exhaustive list of specific use-cases will be analysed in the final part of these Guidelines.

2  ANALYSIS

2.1  Key elements for the applicability of Article 5(3) ePD

6.

Article 5(3) ePD applies if:

a.  CRITERION A:  the operations carried out relate to ‘information’. It should be noted that the term

used is not ’personal data’, but ‘information’.

b.  CRITERION B: the operations carried out involve a  ‘terminal equipment’ of a subscriber or user
(B.1), which imply the need to assess the notion of a ‘public communications network’ (B.2).

c.  CRITERION C the operations carried out indeed constitute ‘storage’ (C.1) or a ‘gaining of access’
(C.2).  Those two notions can be studied independently, as reminded in  WP29 Opinion 9/2014:
‘Use of the words “stored or accessed” indicates that the storage and access do not need to occur
within the same communication and do not need to be performed by the same party’5.

For  the  sake  of  readability,  the  entity  gaining  access  to  information  stored  in  the  user’s  terminal
equipment will be hereafter referred to as an ‘accessing entity’.

2.2  Notion of ‘information’ - Criterion A

7.

8.

As  expressed  in  CRITERION  A,  this  section  details  what  is  covered  by  the  notion  of  ‘information’.
The  choice  of  the  term  ‘information’,  encompassing  a  broader  category  than  the  mere  notion
of personal data, is related to the scope of the ePrivacy Directive.

The goal of Article 5(3) ePD is to protect the private sphere of the users, as stated in  its Recital 24:
‘Terminal  equipment  of  users  of  electronic  communications  networks  and  any  information  stored
on such equipment are part of the private sphere of the users requiring protection under the European

4 As stated in Article 5(3) ePD: ‘This shall not prevent any technical storage or access for the sole purpose of
carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or as strictly
necessary in order for the provider of an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or
user to provide the service.’

Convention  for  the  Protection  of  Human  Rights  and  Fundamental  Freedoms’.  It  is  also  protected
by Article 7 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.

In fact, scenarios that do intrude into this private sphere even without involving any personal data are
explicitly covered by the wording of Article 5(3) and Recital 24 ePD, for example the storage of viruses
on the user’s terminal equipment. This shows that the definition of the term ‘information’ should not
be limited to the property of being related to an identified or identifiable natural person.

This has been confirmed by the Court of Justice of the EU: ‘That protection applies to any information
stored in such terminal equipment, regardless of whether or not it is personal data, and is intended,
in particular, as is clear from that recital, to protect users from the risk that hidden identifiers and other
similar devices enter those users’ terminal equipment without their knowledge’6.

The questions on whether the origin of this information and the reasons why it is stored in the terminal
equipment  should  be  considered  when  assessing  the  applicability  of  Article  5(3)  ePD  have  been
previously  clarified.  For  example,  in  the  WP29  Opinion  9/2014:  ‘It  is  not  correct  to  interpret  this
as meaning that the third-party does not require consent to access this information simply because
he  did  not  store  it.  The  consent  requirement  also  applies  when  a  read-only  value  is  accessed
(e.g. requesting the MAC address of a network interface via the OS API)’ 7.

In conclusion, the notion of information includes both non-personal data and personal data, regardless
of how this data  was  stored and by whom, i.e.  whether by an external entity  (also including other
entities than the one having access), by the user, by a manufacturer, or any other scenario.

2.3  Notion of ‘terminal equipment of a subscriber or user’ – Criterion B.1

This  section  builds  on  the  definition  used  in  Directive  2008/63/EC  and  as  referenced  in  Article  2
Directive (EU) 2018/1972, where ‘terminal equipment’ is defined as: ‘equipment directly or indirectly
connected  to  the  interface  of  a  public  telecommunications  network  to  send,  process  or  receive
information;  in  either  case  (direct  or  indirect),  the  connection  may  be  made  by  wire,  optical  fibre
or electromagnetically; a connection is indirect if equipment is placed between the terminal equipment
and the interface of the network’8.

14.  Recital 24 ePD provides a clear understanding of the role of the terminal equipment for the protection
offered by Article 5(3) ePD. The ePD protects users’ privacy not only in relation to the confidentiality
of  their  information  but  also  by  safeguarding  the  integrity  of  the  user’s  terminal  equipment.
This understanding will guide the interpretation of the notion of the terminal equipment throughout
these Guidelines.

15.  Article 3 ePD states that for the ePD to apply the processing of  personal data has to be carried out
in  connection  with  the  provision  of  publicly  available  electronic  communications  services  in  public
communications networks. This entails that a device should be usable in connection with such service
and that, in order to be qualified as a terminal equipment, it should be connected or connectable9
to the interface of a public communications network.  The EDPB notes that the amendments  made

in 200910 in the text of Article 5(3) ePD extended the protection of terminal equipment by deleting
the  reference  to  the  ‘use  of  electronic  communications  network’  as  a  means  to  store  information
or to gain access to information stored in the terminal equipment. Therefore, as long as a device has
a  network  interface  that  makes  it  eligible  for  connection  (even  if  such  connection  is  not  in  place),
Article 5(3) ePD applies to every entity that would store and gain access to information already stored
in the terminal equipment whatever the means of access to the terminal equipment is, and whether
connected or disconnected from a network

16.

Equipment  that  are  part  of  the  public  electronic  communications  network  itself  would  not
be considered terminal equipment under Article 5(3) ePD11.

17.  A  terminal  equipment  may  be  comprised  of  any  number  of  individual  pieces  of  hardware,
which  together  form  the  terminal  equipment.  This  may  or  may  not  take  the  form  of  a  physically
enclosed  device  hosting  all  the  display,  processing,  storage  and  peripheral  hardware  (for  example,
smartphones,  laptops,  network-attached  storage  device,  connected  cars  or  connected  TVs,  smart
glasses).

18.

19.

20.

The ePD acknowledges that the protection of the confidentiality of the information stored on a user’s
terminal equipment and integrity of the user’s terminal equipment is not limited to the protection
of the private sphere of natural persons but also concerns the right to respect for their correspondence
or  the  legitimate  interests  of  legal  persons12.  As  such,  a  terminal  equipment  that  allows  for  this
correspondence and the legitimate interests of the legal persons to be carried out is protected under
Article 5(3) ePD.

The  user  or  subscriber  may  own  or  rent  or  otherwise  be  provided  with  the  terminal  equipment.
Multiple users or subscribers may share the same terminal equipment.

This  protection  is  guaranteed  by  the  ePD  to  the  terminal  equipment  associated  to  the  user
or subscriber, and it is not dependant on whether the user set up the means of access (for example
if they initiated the electronic communication) or even on whether the user is aware of the said means
of access).

2.4  Notion of ‘public communications network’ – Criterion B.2

21.  As the situation regulated by the ePD is the one related to ‘the provision of publicly available electronic
communications services in public communications networks in the Community’13, and the definition
of a terminal equipment specifically mentions the notion of a ‘public communications network’, it is
crucial to clarify this notion to identify the context in which Article 5(3) ePD applies.

10  Directive  2009/136/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  25  November  2009  amending
Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks and
services, Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the
electronic  communications  sector  and  Regulation  (EC)  No  2006/2004  on  cooperation  between  national
authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws (Text with EEA relevance), OJ L 337,
18.12.2009, Article 2(5) and Recital 65.

12 Indeed, as reminded in Art. 2(13) of Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 11 December 2018 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code, the user can be a natural or
a legal person.
13 Article 3 ePD.

22.

The notion of electronic communications network is not defined within the ePD itself. That concept
was referred to originally in Directive 2002/21/EC (the Framework Directive) on a common regulatory
framework for electronic communications networks and services14, subsequently replaced by Article
2(1) of Directive 2018/1972 (the European Electronic Communications Code). It now reads:

”electronic communications network” means transmission systems, whether or not based on a
permanent  infrastructure  or  centralised  administration  capacity,  and,  where  applicable,
switching or routing equipment and other resources, including network elements which are not
active, which permit the conveyance of signals by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic
means, including satellite networks, fixed (circuit- and packet-switched, including internet) and
mobile networks, electricity cable systems, to the extent that they are used for the purpose of
transmitting signals, networks used for radio and television broadcasting, and cable television
networks, irrespective of the type of information conveyed.15

23.

24.

25.

26.

This definition is neutral with respect to the transmission technologies. An electronic communications
network,  according  to  this  definition,  is  any  network  system  that  allows  transmission  of  electronic
signals between its nodes, regardless of the equipment and protocols used.

The  notion  of  electronic  communications  network  under  Directive  2018/1972  does  not  depend  on
the public or private nature of the infrastructure, nor on the way the network is deployed or managed
(‘whether  or  not based  on  a permanent  infrastructure or  centralised  administration  capacity’16.)  As
a result, the definition of electronic communications network, under Article 2 of Directive 2018/1972,
is  broad  enough  to  cover  any  type  of  infrastructure.  It  includes  networks  managed  or  not  by
an  operator,  networks  co-managed  by  a  group  of  operators,  or  even  ad-hoc  networks  in  which
a terminal equipment may dynamically join or leave a mesh of other terminal equipment using short
range transmission protocols.

This  definition  of  network  does  not  give  any  limitation  with  regards  to  the  number  of  terminal
equipment  present  in  the  network  at  any  time.  Some  networking  schemes  rely  on  nodes  relaying
information in an ad-hoc manner to nodes presently connected17 and can at some point in time have
as  little  as  two  peers  communicating.  Such  cases  would  be  within  the  general  scope  of  the  ePD
directive, as long as the network protocol allows for further inclusion of peers.

The  public  availability  of  the  communication  network  is  necessary  for  the  device  to  be  considered
a terminal equipment and in consequence for the applicability of Article 5(3) ePD. It should be noted
that  the  fact  that  the  network  is  made  available  to  a  limited  subset  of  the  public  (for  example,
subscribers,  whether paying or not, subject to eligibility conditions) does not make such a network
private18.

2.5  Notion of ‘gaining access’ – Criterion C.1

To  correctly  frame  the  notion  of  ‘gaining  access’,  it  is  important  to  consider  the  scope  of  the ePD,
stated in its Article 1: ‘to ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms,
and in particular the right to privacy, with respect to the processing of personal data in the electronic
communication sector and to ensure the free movement of such data and of electronic communication
equipment and services in the Community’.

In  a  nutshell,  the  ePD  is  a  privacy  preserving  legal  instrument  aiming  to  protect  the confidentiality
of  communications  and  the  integrity  of  devices.  In  Recital  24  ePD,  it  is  clarified  that,  in  the  case
of natural persons, the user’s terminal equipment is part of their private sphere and that accessing
information stored on it without their knowledge may seriously intrude upon their privacy.

Legal persons are also safeguarded by the ePD19. In consequence, the notion of ‘gaining access’ under
Article 5(3) ePD, has to be interpreted in a way that safeguards those rights against violation by third
parties.

Storing information or gaining access can be independent operations, and performed by independent
entities.  Storing  of  information  and  access  to  information  already  stored  do  not  need  to  be  both
present for Article 5(3) ePD to apply.

31.  As noted in the WP29 Opinion 9/2014: ‘Use of the words “stored or accessed” indicates that the storage
and access do not need to occur within the same communication and do not need to be performed
by the same party. Information that is stored by one party (including information stored by the user
or  device  manufacturer)  which  is  later  accessed  by  another  party  is  therefore  within  the  scope
of  Art.  5(3)’20.  Consequently,  there  are  no  restrictions  placed  on  the  origin  of  information
on the terminal equipment for the notion of access to apply.

32.  Whenever  an  entity  takes  steps  towards  gaining  access  to  information  stored  in  the  terminal
equipment, Article 5(3) ePD would apply. Usually this entails the accessing entity to proactively send
specific  instructions  to  the  terminal  equipment  in  order  to  receive  back  the  targeted  information.
For example, this is the case for cookies, where the accessing entity instructs the terminal equipment
to proactively send information on each subsequent Hypertext Transfer Protocol (‘HTTP’) call.

33.

34.

That  is  equally  the case  when  the  accessing  entity  distributes  software  on  the  terminal  equipment
of the user that is stored and will then proactively call an Application Programming Interface (‘API’)
endpoint over the network. Additional examples would include JavaScript code, where the accessing
entity instructs the browser of the user to send asynchronous requests with the targeted information.
Such access clearly falls within the scope of Article 5(3) ePD, as the accessing entity explicitly instructs
the terminal equipment to send the information.

In  some  cases,  the  entity  instructing  the  terminal  equipment  to  send  back  the  targeted  data  and
the entity receiving information might not be the same. This may result from the provision and/or use
of  a  common  mechanism  between  the  two  entities.  Instructing  the  device  to  send  already  stored
information (for example, through the use of a protocol, or an SDK21 that imply the proactive sending
of information by the terminal equipment) makes an intrusion into the terminal equipment possible,
therefore  such  an  access  triggers  the  applicability  of  Article  5(3).)  ePD.  As  noted  in  WP29  Opinion
09/2014, this can be the case when a website instructs the terminal equipment to send information

2.6  Notions of storage of information’ and ‘stored information’ – Criterion C.2

Storage  of  information  in  the  sense  of  Article  5(3)  ePD  refers  to  placing  information  on  a  physical
electronic storage medium that is part of a user or subscriber’s terminal equipment23.

Typically, information is not stored in the terminal equipment of a user or subscriber through direct
access  to  the  memory  of  the  device  by  another  party,  but  rather  by  instructing  software  on
the  terminal  equipment  to  generate  specific  information.  Storage  taking  place  through  such
instructions  is  considered  to  be  initiated  directly  by  the  other  party.  This  includes  making  use
of established protocols such as browser cookie storage as well as customized software, regardless
of who created or installed the protocols or software on the terminal equipment.

The ePD does not place any upper or lower limit on the length of time that information must persist
on a storage medium to be counted as stored, nor is there an upper or lower limit on the amount
of information to be stored.

Similarly, the notion  of storage does not depend on the type of medium on  which the information
 is  stored.  Typical  examples  would  include  hard  disc  drives  (‘HDD’),  solid  state  drives  (‘SSD’),
electrically-erasable  programmable  read-only  memory  (‘EEPROM’)  and  random-access  memory
(‘RAM’), but less typical scenarios involving a medium such as magnetic tape or central processing unit
(‘CPU’) cache are not excluded from the scope of application. The storage medium may be connected
internally (e.g. through a SATA connection), externally (e.g. through a USB connection)

‘Stored  information’  refers  to  information  already  existing  on  the  terminal  equipment,  regardless
of  the  source  or  nature  of  this  information.  This  includes  any  result  from  information  storage
in the sense of Article 5(3) ePD as described above (either by the same party that would later gain
access  or  by  another  third  party).  It  furthermore  includes  results  of  information  storage  processes
beyond  the  scope  of  Article  5(3),)  ePD,  such  as:  storage  on  the  terminal  equipment  by  the  user
or  subscriber  themselves,  or  by  a  hardware  manufacturer  (such  as  the  MAC  addresses  of  network
interface  controllers),  sensors  integrated  into  the  terminal  equipment  or  processes  and  programs

3  USE CASES

40.  As  pointed  out  in  the  introduction  of  these  guidelines24,  they  do  not  analyse  the  application
of the exemptions to the obligation to collect consent provided by Article 5(3) ePD. The EDPB reminds
that for all of the cases where there is a storage of information or a gaining of access to information
already stored, it would have to be assessed if a consent is needed or whether an exemption under
Article 5(3) ePD could apply. The reader should therefore consider the exemptions in their use case,
in conjunction with this technical analysis.

41.  Without prejudice of the specific context in which those technical categories can be used which are
necessary to qualify whether Article 5(3) ePD is applicable, it is possible to identify, in a non-exhaustive

manner,  broad  categories  of  identifiers  and  information  that  are  widely  used  and  can  be  subject
to the applicability of Article 5(3) ePD.

42.  Network  communication  usually  relies  on  a  layered  model  that  necessitates  the  use  of  identifiers
to  allow  for  a  proper  establishment  and  carrying  out  of  the  communication.  The  communication
of  those  identifiers  to  remote  actors  is  instructed  through  software  following  agreed  upon
communication protocols. As outlined above, the fact that the receiving entity might not be the entity
instructing the sending of information does not preclude the application of Article 5(3) ePD. This might
concern routing identifiers such as the MAC or IP address of the terminal equipment, but also session
identifiers (SSRC, Websocket identifier), or authentication tokens.

43.

In the same manner, the application protocol can include several mechanisms to provide context data
(such as HTTP header including ‘accept’ field or user agent), caching mechanism (such as ETag25) or
other functionalities (cookies being one of them, or HSTS26). Once again, relying on those mechanisms
to  collect  information  (for  example  in  the  context  of  fingerprinting27  or  the  tracking  of  resource
identifiers) can lead to the application of Article 5(3) ePD.

44.  On  the  other  hand,  there  are  some  contexts  in  which  local  applications  installed  in  the  terminal
equipment uses some information strictly inside the terminal, as it might be the case for smartphone
system APIs (access to camera, microphone, GPS sensor, accelerator chip, radio chip, local file access,
contact  list,  identifiers  access,  etc.).  This  might  also  be  the  case  for  web  browsers  that  process
information stored or generated information inside the device (such as cookies, local storage, WebSQL,
or even information provided by the users themselves). The use of such information by an application
would not constitute a ‘gaining of access to information already stored’ in the meaning of Article 5(3)
ePD as long as the information does not leave the device, but when this information or any derivation
of this information is accessed, Article 5(3) ePD would apply.

45.

Finally, in some cases malicious software elements are distributed by actors, for example crypto mining
software  or  more  generally  malware,  exploiting  the  processing  abilities  of  the  terminal  equipment
for the benefit of the distributing actor. The distribution of said malicious software in user’s terminal
equipment  would  constitute  a  ‘storage’  in  the  meaning  of  Article  5(3)  ePD.  In  addition,  should
the software establish a network connection to send information at a later stage, it would constitute
a ‘gaining of access’ in the meaning of Article 5(3) ePD

46.

For a subset of these categories that present a specific interest, either because of their widespread
usage or because a specific study is warranted with regards to the circumstances of their use, a specific
analysis is provided below.

3.1  URL and pixel tracking

47.  A tracking pixel is a hyperlink to a resource, usually an image file, embedded into a piece of content
like a website or an email. This pixel usually fulfils no purpose related to the requested content itself;
its sole purpose is to automatically establish a communication by the client to the host of the pixel,
which would otherwise not have occurred. This is however not systematic and tracking pixels can also
be  created  by  adding  additional  information  to  hyperlink  loading  images  that  are  relevant

25 The HTTP ETag is an identifier that allows to do conditional request based on the validity of the cached client
data.
26 HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) allow servers to specify which resources should always be requested
using HTTPS connections.

to  the  content  displayed  to  the  user.  Establishment  of  the  communication  transmits  various
information to the host of the pixel, depending on the specific use case.

48.

49.

In the case of an email, the sender may include a tracking pixel to detect when the  receiver reads
the email. Tracking pixels on websites may link to an entity collecting many such requests and thus
being  able  to  track  users’  behaviour.  Such  tracking  pixels  may  also  contain  additional  identifiers,
metadata or content as part of the link. These data points may be added by the owner of the website,
possibly related to the user’s activity on that website so that analytical usage reports can be generated.
They may also be dynamically generated through client-side applicative logic supplied by the entity.

Tracking links can function in the same way, but the identifier is appended to  the website address.
When  the  Uniform  Resource  Locator  (‘URL’)  is  visited  by  the  user,  the  targeted  website  loads
the  requested  resource  but  also  collects  an  identifier  which  is  not  relevant  in  terms  of  resource
identification. They are very commonly used by  eCommerce websites to identify the origin of their
inbound  source  of  traffic.  For  example,  such  websites  can  provide  tracked  links  to  partners  to  use
on  their  domain  so  that  the  e-commerce  website  knows  which  of  their  partners  is  responsible  for
a sale and pay a commission, a practice known as affiliate marketing.

50.  Both  tracking  links  and  tracking  pixels  can  be  distributed  through  a  wide  variety  of  channels,
for example through emails, websites, or even, in the case of tracking links, through any kind of text
messaging  systems.  That  distribution  to  the  user’s  terminal  equipment  does  constitute  storage,  at
 the very least through the caching mechanism of the client-side software. As such, Article 5(3) ePD is
applicable, even if this storage is not permanent.

51.

52.

53.

The  addition  of  tracking  information  to  URLs  or  images  (pixels)  sent  to  the  user  constitutes
an  instruction  to  the  terminal  equipment  to  send  back  the  targeted  information  (the  specified
identifier). In the case of dynamically constructed tracking pixels, it is the distribution of the applicative
logic (usually a JavaScript code) that constitutes the instruction. As a consequence, it can be considered
that the collection of identifiers provided through such tracking mechanisms constitutes a ‘gaining of
access’ in the meaning of Article 5(3) ePD, thus it applies to that step as well.

3.2  Local processing

Some  technologies  rely  on  local  processing  instructed  by  software  distributed  on  users’  terminal
equipment, where the information produced by the local processing is then made available to selected
actors  through  client-side  API.  This  may  for  example  be  the  case  for  an  API  provided  by  the  web
browser, where locally generated results may be accessed remotely.

If at any point and for example in the client-side code, the processed information is made available
to a third-party, for example sent back over the network to a server, such an operation (instructed by
the entity producing the client-side code distributed on the user terminal equipment) would constitute
a ‘gaining of access to information already stored’. The fact that this information is being produced
locally does not preclude the application of Article 5(3) ePD.

3.3  Tracking based on IP only

Adopted

13

54.

Some providers are developing solutions that only rely on the collection of one component,  namely
the IP address, in order to track the navigation28 of the user, in some case across multiple domains.
In that context Article 5(3) ePD could apply even though the instruction to make the IP available has
been made by a different entity than the receiving one.

55.  However, gaining access to IP addresses would only trigger the application of Article 5(3) ePD in cases
where this information originates from the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user. While it is not
systematically the case (for example when CGNAT29 is activated), the static outbound IPv4 originating
from a user’s router would fall within that case, as well as IPV6 addresses since they are partly defined
by the host. Unless the entity can ensure that the IP address does not  originate from the terminal
equipment of a user or subscriber, it has to take all the steps pursuant to the Article 5(3) ePD.

56.  While  the  present  guidelines  do  not  analyse  the  application  of  the  exemptions  to  the  obligation
to collect consent provided by Article 5(3) ePD, it is important to once again recall that the applicability
of this article does not systematically mean that consent needs to be collected. The EDPB thus reminds
that in each case it would have to be assessed if a consent is needed or whether an exemption under
Article 5(3) ePD could apply30.

3.4

Intermittent and mediated IoT reporting

57.

58.

59.

60.

IoT  (Internet  of  Things)  devices  produce  information  continuously  over  time,  for  example  through
sensors  embedded  in  the  device,  which  may  or  may  not  be  locally  pre-processed.  In  many  cases,
information is made available to a remote server, but the modalities of that collection can vary.

Some IoT devices have a direct connection to a public communication network with a cellular SIM card.
Other  may  have  an  indirect  connection  to  a  public  communication  network,  for  example  through
the  use  of  WIFI  or  the  relay  of  information  to  another  device  through  a  point-to-point  connection
(for example, through Bluetooth). The other device can for example be a smartphone or a dedicated
gateway which may or may not pre-process the information before sending it to the server.

IoT  devices  might  be  instructed  by  the  manufacturer  to  always  stream  the  collected  information,
yet still locally cache the information first, for example until a connection is available.

In any case the IoT device, where it is connected (directly or indirectly) to a public communications
network, would itself be considered a terminal equipment. The fact that the information is streamed
or cached for intermittent reporting does not change the nature of that information. In both situations
Article 5(3) ePD would apply as  there is, through the instruction of code on the IoT device to send
the dynamically stored data to the remote server, a ‘gaining of access’.

3.5  Unique Identifier

61.  A  common  tool  used  by  companies  is  the  notion  of  ’unique  identifiers‘  or  ’persistent  identifiers‘.
Such  identifiers  can  be  derived  from  persistent  personal  data  (name  and  surname,  email,  phone
number, etc.), that is hashed on the user’s device, collected and shared amongst several controllers
to uniquely identify a person over different datasets (usage data collected through the use of website

28 This is additional to and independent of the use and function of an IP address for the establishment and
conveyance or transmission of underlying technical communications, or the fact that it may or may not be
personal data (in respect of ePrivacy analysis, it is “information”)
29 Carrier-grade NAT or CGNAT is used by Internet service providers to maximise the use of limited IP address
space. It groups a number of subscribers under the same public IP address.

or  application,  customer  relation  management  (CRM)  data  related  to  online  or  offline  purchase
or subscription, etc.). On websites, the persistent personal data is generally obtained in the context
of authentication or the subscription to newsletters.

62.  As  outlined  before,  the  fact  that  information  is  being  entered  by  the  user  would  not  preclude
the application of Article 5(3) ePD with regards to storage, as this information is stored temporarily
on the terminal equipment before being collected.

63.

In the context of ‘unique identifier’ collection on websites or mobile applications, the entity collecting
is  instructing  the  browser  (through  the  distribution  of  client-side  code)  to  send  that  information.
As such a ’gaining of access’ is taking place and Article 5(3) ePD applies.
